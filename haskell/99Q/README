== Solution ==

All solutions are in QXX/QXX.hs, which XX is the question number.

== How to build and run ==

please install GHC (or haskell-platform) and cabal-install (recommended).

  $ cabal sandbox init   # I don't intend to break your system <3
  $ cabal install

to run specific solution, try:

  $ .cabal-sandbox/bin/99Q01

or add ``.cabal-sandbox/bin'' to your $PATH and just:

  $ 99Q01

or if you prefer plain ghc command.

  $ cd QXX
  $ ghc Main.hs
  $ ./Main
